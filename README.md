# Trim: Discover Ireland's Ancient East

Trim, located in County Meath, is a town with incredible history and is a great attraction for tourists.
An opportunity appeared when I looked at its current web presence. Existing sites are either dated, not aesthetically pleasing, contain too much information or are difficult to navigate. In particular I wanted to focus on three of the oldest structures that were still standing in Trim to this day: Trim Castle, The Yellow Steeple and The Priory of St. John the Baptist.

My aim with this website is to create a modern online presence that grabs the attention of web users, present a brief timeline of these particular structures, inform people how they can best visit these sites and promote events that take place throughout the year.

### Skeleton

+ This website makes use of beautiful nature imagery as hero images and earthy colors for the main sections. 
  It is a one page site and flows from top to bottom.


### Surface

To show off the beauty of Trim I decided to make us of several hero images, they are displayed below. I needed to use overlay boxes to contrast the text from the background.
With regards to fonts used I researched fonts that best compliment nature, from the suggestions online I selected JoseFin Sans and Playfair Display SC. For the sections that did not contain hero images as the background. I used light blue and earthy green colors to be consistent with the nature theme.
